<!--
    The journalist looks for clues for the news.
    An unbiased story must tell all sides.
    But maybe it's best to only tell one.
    For Freedom or Equality, you must choose.
    Or should you?
    While they ponder the question reading this line.
    This is not the right direction.
    There is nothing more to see here.
    No clues lie among this news.
